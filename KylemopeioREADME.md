# New-Mopeio

## Introduction

We were inspired by the Mopeio game, a game that is pretty popular online and involves animals interacting on a map. Based off of that game, we made this version, which 
is arguably simpler, but also varied in its execution. 

We started off by drawing the animals as well as the backgrounds, and then starting work on the other aspects of the game, mainly the food spawning and the animals being 
able to eat that food and then evolve into other animals. 

### Classes

We made classes for all the animals, collectively all extending from the parent Animal class. There are ten animals in total, from the mouse all the way to the dragon. 
Each has there own individual abilities, and generally more evolved animals are more powerful, having more HP and stronger abilities.
